# NLP-Fake-News-Detector
A project-based course for Fake News Detection with Machine Learning proctored by Prof. Ryan Ahmed, with the following objectives:

1. Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets
2. Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
3. Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
4. Understand the concept of tokenizer.
5. Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
6. Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
7. Build and train the deep learning model
8. Access the performance of the trained model

## My Personal Take 
This project really helped me understand all the processes involved in analyzing data and building predictive models for classifying real/fake news. I was introduced to different techniques in visualizing data specially text data. Prof. Ryan Ahmed was a good professor and he explained RNNs and LSTM concepts well.
